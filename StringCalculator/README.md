# StringCalculator
My college project that takes the whole equation as a string
and **magically** works it out rather than inputing all the numbers
separately what most **CLI** Calculators do. Similar to the compute()
function from DataTable class. The aim is to replace that function
with my OSS code.

Current state (WIP):
* Supports simple mathematical calculations
	* Addition
	* Subtraction
	* Multiplication
	* Division
	* Modulus
* Somehow optimes validation

## TODO

- [x] Follow BODMAS
- [ ] Add more mathematical operations
	- [ ] Powers, roots, trigonometry
	- [ ] Algebra
- [ ] Handle larger equations
- [ ] Optimise the algorithm and validation
